### 1. Exploring Text-to-Image Creation

Let's begin by exploring the text-to-image feature. NightCafe Studio offers various art styles, and your first step is to choose a style that resonates with your creative vision.

Select an art style from options like Stable Diffusion, Dalle-2, and others.

Provide a text prompt describing the image you want to create.

Optionally, choose a startup image and specify the aspect ratio you prefer.

Adjust other settings, such as the number of images to be generated and the desired quality.

Click "Create" to generate your image.

Keep in mind that some settings may consume more credits. For example, generating multiple images may cost you more credits, so consider your daily credit limit.

### 2. Exploring Text-to-Video Creation

While some art styles in NightCafe Studio focus on image generation, you can also create videos.

Select an art style that supports video creation.

Enter a text prompt describing the scene or concept you want in your video.

Configure video parameters, including length, frames per second, and quality.

Adjust any other settings you prefer for your video.

Click "Create" to generate your video.

Creating videos consumes more credits than images due to the additional complexity involved.
