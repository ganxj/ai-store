## Application Examples
To enable developers and researchers to fully harness the potential of MovieLLM, here's a brief guide to data generation and model training based on this framework:

### Environment Setup

First, clone the MovieLLM code repository and set up the environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/Deaddawn/MovieLLM-code.git
cd MovieLLM-code
conda create -n MovieLLM python=3.10 -y
conda activate MovieLLM
pip install -e .

```

### Data Generation
MovieLLM allows users to generate scripts and corresponding images as needed. This process can be accomplished using the following code example:

```
from movie_llm import MovieLLMGenerator

generator = MovieLLMGenerator()
script, images = generator.generate_movie("Your creative input goes here")

```

### Model Training
Next, utilize the generated data to train models for further enhancing long video understanding. This can be achieved with the following code example:

```
python train.py --data_path "/path/to/generated/data" --model_config "config.json"

```
